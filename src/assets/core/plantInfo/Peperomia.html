  <h2 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_plantName">How to take care of Peperomia</h2>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">The peperomia plant family is one of the greatest, consisting of over 1000 recorded species. They all share some common characteristics, such as being quite resilient and versatile in a wide variety of growth conditions.</p>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">The main benefit of this plant family is that there are hardly two plants that look alike! You can have a wide array of peperomia plants, but still keep the variation of your plant collection, as no two plants will look alike.
  </p>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Peperomia plants are compact and slow-growing plants. They have sturdy stems and many plants have fleshy leaves with succulent characteristics.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Lighting</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Peperomias thrive best when placed away from direct sunlight. The sunlight should be bright, but indirect. You should be cautious especially in the summer months, as exposure to direct sunlight causes leaf scorching.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Watering</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">You should not water them too frequently. Always wait for the top inch of the soil to dry out before watering the plant again. Primary signs of watering appear as wilted and yellowing leaves and "swampy".</p>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Overwatering is the number one problem that people have when keeping peperomia plants indoors. Many of us plant-lovers tend to be a little bit too enthusiastic about watering, which is actually harmful to the plant.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Soil</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">As overwatering is most commonly a big problem for peperomia plants, it is best to choose a well-draining potting mix, consisting of peat moss and lots of perlite/pumice or coarse sand.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">You can take two different procedures to grow new baby peperomia plants: It can either be done through leaf cuttings or stem cuttings. Trust me, both methods are easy and you should expand your peperomia plants in no time!</p>
  <h5 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagating peperomia plants through leaf cuttings</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Prepare a new pot and a fresh well-draining potting mix</li>
    <li>Clean your equipment. A major cause of death in baby peperomia plants are fungal diseases. Keeping the equipment clean should prevent such ailments.</li>
    <li>Cut a healthy leaf off the plant</li>
    <li>Whole leaves can be used for propagation, but it is best to cut the leaf into two halves along the width of the leaf</li>
    <li>Dip cut edges of the leaf into rooting powder. This will encourage new roots to grow.</li>
    <li>Make a small gutter in the potting soil with a spoon, and insert your leaf-cutting one to two centimetres into the soil. Make sure to insert the edge with the applied rooting powder!</li>
    <li>Thoroughly water the potting media.</li>
    <li>Cover the cuttings. Improvise with anything that comes in handy, a plastic see-through bag should do the work just fine. Also, make sure there is a way for air through come through, so make some aeration holes.</li>
    <li>You should leave the propagating plants in bright indirect light at normal indoor room temperature.</li>
    <li>Remove the cover for a few hours every few days to prevent the build-up of excessive humidity which carries a risk of fungal disease.</li>
    <li>First, you will see new roots develop. After this, a new shoot will start growing and finally, new leaves will start forming.</li>
    <li>After the plants have developed fully and have several new leaves, they can be repotted into individual pots.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagating peperomia plants through stem cuttings</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Prepare a fresh well-draining potting mix and a new pot</li>
    <li>Cut a healthy stem off the plant with scissors</li>
    <li>Dip the place where the stem is cut into rooting powder.</li>
    <li>Make a small hole for the stem in the potting mix</li>
    <li>Insert the stem cutting</li>
    <li>Thoroughly water the potting mix</li>
    <li>Follow the remaining steps, which are identical to the steps taken for propagation by leaf cuttings</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Additional information</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Peperomia plants aren't poisonous and are totally safe for humans and pets. There is no danger either from contact or ingestion. There are no worries if any pet or small children ingests a part of a peperomia plant - a stomach ache, if it does happen, is the worst scenario.</p>
