  <h2 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_plantName">How to take care of peace lily</h2>
  <p>
    Peace lilies are perfect house plants since they can adapt to a wide range of conditions, besides being very easy to take care of. But why are peace lilies named so? The upper part of the flower comprises of a white sheath, which is quite like a flag of surrender - and that's the origin of the first part of their name! 
  </p>

  <p>
    Peace lilies are often regarded as floor plants since they are most often kept on the floors due to their size: They can grow up to 50 inches (1,27m)! 
  </p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Lighting</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Despite one would anticipate that due to their origins from the tropical forests the peace lilies require lots of sunlight for growth, that is not exactly the case. Just the opposite, peace lilies prefer being kept away from direct sunlight and should be kept in partial shade. Having them placed too close to a window may result in yellowing of the leaves due to intense sunlight.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Watering</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Peace lilies originate from tropical forests of South America. With this in mind, it becomes evident that they require moist conditions.  Watering peace lilies is relatively easy, as they can actually "tell" you when they require water. You should just wait for them to become soggy or limp, and that is when you should water them. </p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Soil</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Peace lilies should be potted in regular peat-based (or coco-coir for that matter) potting mixtures, with moderate amounts of perlite, pumice, sand or bark.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Similarly to snake plants, peace lilies grow out of rhizomes as well, which are modified plant "stems" that grow under the soil and "shoot" out new baby peace lilies. It is, therefore, best to wait for a peace lily to take up the entire pot (or at least grow to proper size) before removing it out of the pot. Then, remove all the soil from the roots and cut the connections between different rhizomes (they appear as clumps or clusters of plant tissue) and replant the newly acquired plants.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Additional Information</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>peace lilies are poisonous! All parts of the plant contain a substance called calcium oxalate, which can cause stomach irritation if ingested. With that in mind, it is best to keep peace lilies out of reach of small children and pets, especially cats.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>NASA carried out studies which analysed which plants are best for cleaning indoor air. Peace lilies were discovered to have an immense role in purifying the air and improving its quality.
