  <h2 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_plantName">How to take care of spider plant</h2>

  <p>
    The spider plant is regarded as one of the most versatile houseplants. It can grow in a broad range of conditions, while enduring only from few problems, besides the inclination of the leaf browning. The spider plant is named so because of its spider-like plants, or spiderettes, which suspend down from the mother plant similar to spiders on a web.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Lighting</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Despite their desert-like appearance, spider plants prefer being placed under indirect sunlight most. Having them placed in direct sunlight may scorch the spider plant if the sun rays are too strong.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Watering</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">An important note to consider is the use of tap water in spider plants. In many countries around the world, tap water contains massive amounts of fluoride in tap water. Since spider plants are quite sensitive to being watered with fluoride-containing water, it is best to water them with either distilled or purified water.</p>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">A general rule of thumb when watering spider plants is to keep the soil moist, but not completely arid or not completely soggy as well. If the top inch of the soil is dry, then you should water the plant.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Soil</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Spider plants thrive best in arid conditions. They require a well-draining potting mixture, containing lots of drainage agents, such as perlite or pumice. </p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Spider plants reproduce through rhizomes. Rhizomes are special underground clumps, which are connected with roots to the mother plant. These clumps (rhizomes) shoot out new baby plants of the mother spider plant. Propagating the new plantlets simply involves taking out the mother plant with all of its rhizomes and then separating them from the mother plant by using sharp shears or a knife.</p>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Once the plantlets are separated from the mother plant, there are two options. You can either</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>root the baby plantlets directly into a freshly prepared potting mixture</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      root the baby plantlets in a cup of water first, so they recover, and rooting them into the potting mixture later on
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Additional information</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><p>trim dead leaf tips or leaves: This helps the plant to direct its energy into growing health leaves. Also, make sure to use distilled water, since dead leaf tips may be a sign of mineral buildup in the potting mixture.</p></li>
  </ul>
