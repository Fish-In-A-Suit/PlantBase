  <h2 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_plantName">How to take care of the ZZ plant</h2>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">ZZ plants, which are also recognisable under the name "Zanzibar Gem", originating from Africa. ZZ plant features arrays of wide, waxy, dark-green leaves and accepts low light conditions. According to a NASA study, the ZZ plant is also an air purifier, as it removes toxins such as benzene and toluene from the air.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Lighting</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">ZZ plants thrive best in indirect light and can also grow completely well in darker environments. If placed in direct sunlight the leaves might become scorched.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Watering</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">ZZ plants are probably among the most insensitive indoor plants to watering. It is best to forget about watering altogether and water only occasionally. Do pay attention, however, not to water excessively, as keeping the soil soggy may result in rotting and dying of the plant.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Soil</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">No special type of potting soil is required. Any soil that is at least somewhat well-draining will cater for perfect growing conditions.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">There are two ways to propagate ZZ plants, albeit both are rather slow:</p>
  <h5 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation through rhizome division</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Note: rhizome division in the case of ZZ plants is a very slow process, as the plant usually forms very few rhizomes</li>
    <li>When a new rhizome forms (a baby plant in the same pot as the mother plant), dig out soil around the baby plant to uncover the root connection between the rhizome and the mother plant.</li>
    <li>Cut the connection between the rhizome and the mother plant. Gently dig out more soil around the rhizome and pull it out of the pot.</li>
    <li>Replant the rhizome in a new pot with a freshly prepared potting mixture.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation through leaf cuttings</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Note: this process may take up to nine months in regular house conditions. </li>
    <li>Cut one of the leaves of the plant</li>
    <li>Take out a glass and pour about 3-4 cm of water into it</li>
    <li>Place the leaf top down into the glass of water, making sure that it remains in an upright position with the cut area inside the water</li>
    <li>In greenhouse conditions (keeping the glass constantly at 26 degrees Celsius or 80F), the process of growing mature roots takes about one month. In regular home conditions, however, the process may take up to nine months.</li>
    <li>When the roots are fully developed, take out the cutting</li>
    <li>Root the cutting in a freshly prepared potting mix</li>
    <li>Some fertilizer may be added to boost the initial growth</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Additional information</h4>
  <p>All parts of the ZZ plant are toxic, so keep it away from pets and toddlers.</p>
