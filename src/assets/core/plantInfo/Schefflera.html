  <h2 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_plantName">How to take care of Schefflera</h2>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Schefflera, also known as the Dwarf umbrella tree, is an extremely adorable indoor plant, which adds a touch of tropics to the indoor environment. This popular indoor house plant features oval-shaped leaves growing in an umbrella pattern. It requires very little to grow happily and should, therefore, live to old age even in the hands of the clumsiest indoor plants enthusiast.</p>
  
  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Lighting</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Schefflera plants should never be placed in direct sunlight, as they cannot tolerate it. They are considered as "medium-light" plants, which means that they thrive best in indirect light. </p>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">A common occurrence, which many owners of dwarf umbrella trees experience is the tree becoming floppy. This most usually has to do with the plant receiving insufficient light, so make sure to relocate it to a brighter environment, should that happen.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Watering</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Schefflera plants are not so sensitive to water conditions as some other plants which require well-draining potting soil. However, you must still take care to not water to excess. It is best to wait until the soil in the pot dries out and then water thoroughly and deeply.</p>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">A sign of overwatering is the occurrence of yellow leaves, that often start falling off the plant. If that happens, make sure to reduce the amount of water you spend on your plant!</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Soil</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Schefflera plants do good in both regular and drainage potting mixes. However, to achieve the best growth conditions, choose a well-draining potting mix instead. </p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Propagation of Dwarf umbrella tree plants is possible through stem cuttings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cut a mature stem, growing outwards from the plant. Make sure to cut at the base of the stem, so the entire stem is captured.</li>
    <li>Dip the cut end of the stem into rooting hormone powder.</li>
    <li>Prepare a fresh regular potting mix and fill a small pot with it.</li>
    <li>Dig a hole in the potting mix and place the stem into the hole (the part of the stem cut facing down the hole) and firm the soil around the stem.</li>
    <li>Place the pot into a bright area, but away from direct sunlight. Stem cuttings are sensitive and require indirect sunlight.</li>
    <li>For better growth conditions, it is best to have the cutting in rather humid conditions, so misting the cutting with a plant mister every few days helps to increase humidity.</li>
    <li>Keep the soil moist by watering, but do not overwater to the point when the soil gets soggy. </li>
    <li>The cutting should soon shoot out roots and grow into a self-sufficient plant, which can be planted into a larger pot after a few months.</li>
  </ul>
