  <h2 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_plantName">How to take care of Aloe vera</h2>
  <p>Aloe Vera, a neatly looking thick and soft-stemmed plant, is a popular medicinal plant that has been used and cultivated since the dawn of our age.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Lighting</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Aloe vera plants should be placed in indirect sunlight. Direct sunlight may sometimes be harmful, as it may dry out the leaves, which can be spotted in a yellowish colouration. If that appears, make sure to put your plant somewhere with less intense lighting.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Watering</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Aloe vera does not require much water to grow. Allow the soil to dry between the waterings. As aloe vera is prone to rotting in humid conditions, avoid from watering too frequently. Therefore, watering about once per three weeks should create just the perfect conditions for your plant. Also, make sure the pot has at least one drainage hole so that the water is allowed to escape out of the soil.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Soil</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Like most succulents, Aloe Vera too requires a drainage potting mix. The water should be allowed to flow quickly through the soil and not be absorbed for too long, therefore such potting soil is the best to achieve just that.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Reproducing your own new little Aloe Vera plants from an existing plant can be either achieved through leaf cuttings or through separating the offsets from the mother plant. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Propagation the aloe vera through leaf cuttings is rather hard to achieve. The leaves have high water content and are inclined towards rotting, so most leaf cuttings might start to rot, which can be seen when they start to become yellowish.
    <br>
    <br>
    Aloe vera offsets (also called buds or pups) are baby plants which share a part of the root with the mother plant. For best results, it is advised to wait until a specific offset is well developed before separating it from the mother plant (ie has at least three true aloe leaves), so it can sustain itself in the new environment. So, when the aloe offset is mature enough, take out a pair of sharp scissors or a sharp knife. Remove all of the soil around the offset to reveal the root connection between the shoot and the main plant. Then, cut the root connection and place the new plant in a pot with freshly prepared potting mixture. Then, allow it to sit for one week before watering it.</p>
