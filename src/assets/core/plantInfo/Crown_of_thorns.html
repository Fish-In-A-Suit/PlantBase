  <h2 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_plantName">How to take care of the Crown of thorns</h2>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Crown of thorns is an evergreen succulent with adorable tiny pink or red bracts. Its name derives from a legend that the thorny crown of Jesus was made from this plant's stems, which are, as the name suggests, full of thorns.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Lighting</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Crown of thorns can grow in both direct or indirect sunlight. They even prefer to be placed outside, if the temperature conditions allow so.  It is best to locate it at a western window, where it can receive direct sunlight. These plants can also be kept in indirect sunlight, but then the flowering is not so intense as if it was placed in direct sunlight.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Watering</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Crown of thorns retains a lot of water in its thick, thorny stems and therefore it doesn't require regular watering. When watering, water deeply, but always leave the top two inches of soil to dry out before watering again.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Soil</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Crown of thorns is not too picky about soil, but it grows the best in a well-draining potting mix or a succulent mix. There is usually no need to fertilise the soil, as the plant does well on itself.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">If you already have one crown of thorns, there is a great chance that you want more! Luckily, crown of thorns plants are easy to propagate by stem cuttings.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cut one of the mature stems of the plant and dip it into warm water for five minutes to stop the sap from running</li>
    <li>Place the stem cutting onto a paper towel and leave it there for 3-4 days until a callus forms</li>
    <li>Prepare a fresh potting mix</li>
    <li>Dig a hole for the stem cutting into the potting mix and plunge the end of the cutting where the callus is formed into the hole. Firm the soil around</li>
    <li>Place the pot in a warm location away from direct sunlight.</li>
    <li>Leave the cutting in the pot for about a month. If you feel resistance after you gently tug it, the new plant is ready to be repotted into a permanent container.</li>
    <li>If the plant has not yet developed mature roots, you should leave it in the container a couple more weeks</li>
  </ul>
