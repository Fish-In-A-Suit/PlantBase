  <h2 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_plantName">How to take care of the Snake plant</h2>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Lighting</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Despite the mother-in-law's tongues are known for their resilience, they thrive best when placed in indirect light. They can also withstand being fully exposed to sun or being kept at a low light, indirect light is ideal for the perfect growth conditions.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Watering</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Snake plants require extremely little water to grow. Even more, too much water is dangerous for their growth, so allow the soil to dry between waterings. Especially in the winter you must pay extra caution not to over water, as that might cause rotting. Another point to remember is to refrain from pouring water over the leaves when watering, as that might cause rotting of the snake plant as well.</p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Soil</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">The soil for the snake plant has to be as dry as possible, therefore a soil that contains a lot of drainage agents - perlite, pumice, sand, etc. is required, as they are prone to rotting in humid soil. </p>

  <h4 class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_header">Propagation</h4>
  <p class="ai_plantInfoExplanation_text">Although propagation of the snake plant can be done anytime, it is best to propagate it in spring, as summertime will boost the growth of the new plants. The fastest way of propagation is through <b>division</b>: The snake plant grows out of rhizomes (a modified plant stem that grows under the soil and shoots out new plants). For propagation through division you are going to have to pull the whole plant from the pot and use either sharp shears or a knife to cut it into smaller sections. Then, plant each new smaller plant into a freshly prepared potting mix. Another process of propagation for snake plants is propagation through <b>leaf cuttings</b>. First, cut off one leaf of the plant and leave it somewhere so that hard plant tissue forms over the wounded surface where the cut was made (the formation of such tissue is called "callus"). Then, place it in a container filled with water and place the container in indirect ligt. Change the water every few days. As you see little roots, plant the newly acquired plant into a potting mix.</p>
